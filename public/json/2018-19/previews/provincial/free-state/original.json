Section 114(1) and (2) of the Constitution provide further for the powers of a Provincial Legislature to include; (a) the consideration, passing, amendment or rejection of bills; (b) to initiate or prepare legislation, except money bills; (c) to ensure that all provincial executive organs of state in the province are accountable to it and (d) to maintain oversight of the exercise of provincial executive authority in the province, including the implementation of legislation and any provincial organ of state.\nIn addition to its constitutional mandate and obligations, the general and specific powers of the Legislature are set out in Rules 127 to 130 of the Standing Rules and Orders.\nThe Legislature has developed a range of policies pertaining to elected representatives, political parties, staff and various institutional practices in order to guide and regulate the daily implementation of services and projects.  In respect of such policies, the review highlighted the need to ensure that existing shortcomings and weaknesses are identified and that key legislation and good governance principles, are incorporated into the existing policy framework. \nThe provincial strategic outcomes developed by the Executive are the key points of departure that define the priorities for the province.  Within this framework, the Legislature has to engage with and identify whether there are any gaps or whether enabling policy is required to support the achievement of provincial goals. The Legislature, also has to prioritise how it will meaningfully perform oversight to ensure delivery against the stated strategies.  \n\n## Vision\n\nThe vision of the Free State Legislature is in line with its mandate as derived from the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (Act 108 of 1996). The vision encapsulates the core principles of the Legislature as follows; “An Activist Legislature that Champions Democracy”.\n\n## Mission\n\nTo promote good governance and a culture of human rights through oversight, law-making and public participation. \n\n","percentage_of_budget":0.7257400359904702,"programmes":[{"amount":123531000.0,"percentage":48.80372000410876,"slug":"administration","title":"Administration"},{"amount":25998000.0,"percentage":10.27109885507945,"slug":"direct-charges","title":"Direct Charges"},{"amount":66615000.0,"percentage":26.317764836953515,"slug":"facilities-for-members-and-political-parties","title":"Facilities For Members And Political Parties"},{"amount":36974000.0,"percentage":14.607416303858278,"slug":"parliamentary-services","title":"Parliamentary Services"}],"slug":"free-state-legislature","title":"Free State Legislature","total":253118000.0},{"description":"","percentage_of_budget":29.82838340631692,"programmes":[{"amount":302960000.0,"percentage":2.912149235536795,"slug":"administration","title":"Administration"},{"amount":2502744000.0,"percentage":24.057182553288552,"slug":"central-hospital-services","title":"Central Hospital Services"},{"amount":0.0,"percentage":0.0,"slug":"direct-charges","title":"Direct Charges"},{"amount":4401708000.0,"percentage":42.310637005730776,"slug":"district-health-services","title":"District Health Services"},{"amount":686598000.0,"percentage":6.599801428641048,"slug":"emergency-medical-services","title":"Emergency Medical Services"},{"amount":197412000.0,"percentage":1.8975878164965334,"slug":"health-care-support-services","title":"Health Care Support Services"},{"amount":641901000.0,"percentage":6.170159448244997,"slug":"health-facilities-management","title":"Health Facilities Management"},{"amount":264005000.0,"percentage":2.5377012111430273,"slug":"health-science-training","title":"Health Science & Training"},{"amount":1405985000.0,"percentage":13.514781300918274,"slug":"provincial-hospital-services","title":"Provincial Hospital Services"}],"slug":"health","title":"Health","total":10403313000.0},{"description":"","percentage_of_budget":3.990506466591647,"programmes":[{"amount":131461000.0,"percentage":9.445543757696989,"slug":"administration","title":"Administration"},{"amount":0.0,"percentage":0.0,"slug":"direct-charges","title":"Direct Charges"},{"amount":1401000.0,"percentage":0.1006626056741808,"slug":"housing-assets-management-property-man","title":"Housing Assets Management Property  Man"},{"amount":1235108000.0,"percentage":88.7431759950222,"slug":"housing-development","title":"Housing Development"},{"amount":23808000.0,"percentage":1.7106176416066357,"slug":"housing-needs-research-planning","title":"Housing Needs, Research & Planning"}],"slug":"human-settlements","title":"Human Settlements","total":1391778000.0},{"description":"","percentage_of_budget":7.961094491863334,"programmes":[{"amount":280531000.0,"percentage":10.10336709273794,"slug":"administration","title":"Administration"},{"amount":0.0,"percentage":0.0,"slug":"direct-charges","title":"Direct Charges"},{"amount":24595000.0,"percentage":0.885792706139035,"slug":"provincial-secretariat-for-police-services","title":"Provincial Secretariat For Police Services"},{"amount":1704180000.0,"percentage":61.376304693963036,"slug":"transport-infrastructure","title":"Transport Infrastructure"},{"amount":355224000.0,"percentage":12.793446970747413,"slug":"transport-operations","title":"Transport Operations"},{"amount":412079000.0,"percentage":14.841088536412581,"slug":"transport-regulations","title":"Transport Regulations"}],"slug":"police-roads-and-transport","title":"Police, Roads And Transport","total":2776609000.0},{"description":"## Mandate\n\nIn terms of the Constitution, the Premier (supported by the Department), is responsible for:\n\n * Implementing provincial legislation;\n * Implementing all national legislation within functional areas;\n * Administering in the province  national legislation outside functional areas;
